# SharkSurfer

This is the first video game I have ever created! Many thanks to my friends whom inspired me, and to [KnifeCircus on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwjglHy7pCPF4ES-S7FKxQg), 
whose code I often used as abenchmark. 

The three files containing all the code can be found on the master branch, named index.html, surf_style.css, and surf_script.js. 

To play, simply move the surfer with the left and right arrow keys to avoid the obstacles.

Here is some sample game play. Enjoy!
